This Titanic Project showcases my data creation as well as chart creation within Excel.

In this Excel Workbook, You will find 3 different spreadsheets.
  1. Passengers
  2. Charts

**Passengers** is where all of the data is stored. The data has been converted into a table and has the following headers:
  1. PassengerID - The ID associated with each passenger
  2. Survived - Whether or not each passenger survived
  3. Pclass - Whether the passenger was in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class
  4. Sex - Whether the passenger was male, female, or unknown
  5. Age - The Age of the passenger
  6. SibSp - The number of siblings or/and spouses each passenger had on board
  7. Parch - The number of parents and/or children each passenger had on board
  8. Fare - The cost of each passenger's ticket
  9. Embarked - The location each passenger hopped on the Titanic (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)
  10. Total Depend - (SibSp + Parch) for each passenger
  11. Age Group - Age broken into groups for each passenger (0-16, 17-30, 31-54, 55+, Unknown)

**Charts** includs a variety of different charts based on the table in the **Passengers** worksheet. Charts include different pie charts, bar charts, and clustered column charts that look at the data in unique ways to answer any question contained within.

**Data Log** contains any and all changes that were made within the spreadsheet that differentiates from the original raw file.
